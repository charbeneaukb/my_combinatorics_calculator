# my_combinatorics_calculator
A Python-based Combinatorics Calculator for several variations of permutation and combination problems. Efficiently handles rearrangements and subset formations. User-friendly and modular design. Run combinatorics_calculator.py for interactive calculations.

# Description:
Welcome to my_combinatorics_calculator, a Python-based Combinatorics Calculator that provides efficient calculations for permutations and combinations. Whether you need to determine the number of ways to rearrange a set or form subsets, this calculator has got you covered.

# Features:
**Permutations:**
Specify the number of objects (n) and the range of positions (r_start to r_end).
Choose whether the selection is with or without replacement.
Easily handle identical objects with a flexible input method.
Utilizes a modular design for easy integration and extensibility.

**Combinations:**
Determine the ways to form subsets of specified lengths from a given set.
Input the total number of objects in the set (n) and the range of selections (r_start to r_end).
Manage identical objects efficiently with a user-friendly interface.

**How to Use:**
Run the combinatorics_calculator.py file.
Follow the interactive prompts to input your parameters.
Receive instant results for permutations and combinations.

**Files:**
combinatorics_calculator.py: The main file for executing calculations.
permutation_calculator.py: Handles permutation calculations based on user input.
combination_calculator.py: Manages combination calculations using a modular approach.
factorial_constant.py: Provides a utility function to calculate the factorial constant.

Feel free to explore and customize this Combinatorics Calculator to suit your specific needs. Whether you are a student working on math assignments or a developer integrating combinatorics calculations into your project, my_combinatorics_calculator is designed to make the process efficient and user-friendly.
